function varargout = knn(varargin)
%KNN MATLAB code file for knn.fig
%      KNN, by itself, creates a new KNN or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = KNN returns the handle to a new KNN or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      KNN('Property','Value',...) creates a new KNN using the
%      given property value pairs. Unrecognized properties are passed via
%      varargin to knn_OpeningFcn.  This calling syntax produces a
%      warning when there is an existing singleton*.
%
%      KNN('CALLBACK') and KNN('CALLBACK',hObject,...) call the
%      local function named CALLBACK in KNN.M with the given input
%      arguments.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
